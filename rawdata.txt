Introduction
..........................
Even though the era of the 5G network has not yet fully arrived, 
the limitations of 5G technology mean we must begin with researching 
6G networks now.But what is a 6G network? And how will it differ from 5G networks? 
So far, the 6G network has no standard functions or specifications, 
just many possibilities.Some people contend that 6G networks should 
be more than just a faster version of a 5G network, 
but rather the improvement of the 5G technology in all aspects.
The sixth generation (6G) networks are expected to 
provide a fully connected world with terrestrial wireless, 
satellite communications integration, higher coverage, less energy consumption, 
comprehensive spectral, and cost-effectiveness with improved security.
The design concept of 6G networks is to leverage artificial intelligence (Ai) 
to promote the intelligent and agile development of network services.
While the conventional applications such as multimedia streaming will 
remain, literature envisions new application domains for 6G systems 
such as multi-sensory extended reality (XR) applications, Connected Robotics
and Autonomous Systems (CRAS), and wireless Brain-Computer
Interactions (BCI). Different requirements for these applications 
and their corresponding use cases set different trends
and research directions towards 6G. 

6G will be an autonomous intelligent ecosystem that connects 
everything through multidimensional networks that provide services
in the ground, air, space and underwater aiming to provide quality 
of not just service but life. The distributed heterogeneous networks 
require ubiquitous AI services to ensure the fulfilment of 6G goals. 
Intelligent wireless communications, closed-loop optimisation of networks, 
big data analytics for 6G emphasise the use of AI in diverse aspects of 
6G networks. Hence, AI becomes an integral part of the network, which plays 
a crucial role. 

The security systems designed for 5G using the concepts of SDN
and NFV should be further improved to cater to the security
demands in 6G. The end-to-end automation of future
networks demands proactive threats discovery, intelligent 
mitigation techniques, and self-sustaining networks in 6G. 
Hence, the end-to-end security design leveraging AI techniques is
essential to autonomously identify and respond to potential
threats based on network anomalies rather than cryptographic
methods. 


Challenges
..............................
Network softwarization technologies in 5G such as Software-Defined Networking,
Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), and
network slicing are still applicable for 6G systems thus, their security issues 
would remain in 6G. Due to the massively distributed nature of 6G systems, 
MEC in 6G is subjected to physical security threats, Distributed Denial of Service,
man-in-the-middle attacks. Potential attacks for network slicing are DoS attacks, 
information theft via compromised slices. Attacks on network softwarization 
technologies fail the 6G network from achieving the promised dynamically and
full automation.


With Further enhanced Mobile Broadband
(FeMBB), extreme data rates will pose challenges regarding
traffic processing for security such as attack detection, AI/ML
pipelines, traffic analysis and pervasive encryption. That issue
can be alleviated with distributed security solutions since
traffic should be processed locally and on-the-fly in different
segments of the network, ranging from the edge to the core
service cloud. At this point, DLT will be instrumental with
transparency, security and redundancy attributes. Ultra massive
Machine Type Communication (umMTC) will serve critical
use-cases which impose much more stringent security requirements compared to 5G.

6G applications also have specific vulnerabilities. The connected robotics 
and autonomous systems typically rely on the AI and the VLC technology where 
malicious behaviour, encryption and data transmission can be problematic. 
The multi-sensory XR applications use the molecular communication technology, 
the THz technology and the quantum communication technology, which means they 
are susceptible to access control attacks, malicious behavior, and data transmission 
exposure. Wireless brain-computer interactions use the same techniques as the 
multi-sensory XR application, but have their own unique security and privacy issues.



Better Approaches
................................
Malicious parties have a better potential to attack a distributed network with more vulnerable devices, each having
mesh connectivity, thereby increasing the threat surface. The
definition of sub-networks requires a change in the security
strategy. Security provision for the massive number of devices within each sub-network by the wide area network is
far from practical. A hierarchical security mechanism that
distinguishes the sub-network level communication security
and sub-network to wide area network security would be a
better approach in 6G. 6G networks will coexist with frameworks 
like Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) architecture to
enable short time-to-market of services, low operational cost,
and reduced human error. Full automation equipped with self-learning
causes the attacks to propagate in the closed-loops.
Data privacy protection is challenging due to the vital need
for automation with lesser human intervention in zero-touch
networks. Implementing automated machine ethics is also an
open question in fully automated 6G networks.








Need for autonomous
...............................

Leveraging AI advances is a must in achieving networks self organisation.
Through learning and prediction, AI will be an efficient solution for achieving the convergence in managing
and allocating 6G network resources for various services [2].
Softwarization [38], cloudization [39], virtualization [40], and
slicing [41] which are main techniques for 5G network orchestration, will be also expected to be important characteristics of
6G autonomous network, AI enabled however. 

When it comes to optimising resources of multi-level and
multi-dimensional networks with massiveness of connections,
AI does not just outperform legacy techniques, it however
emerges as a main management technique for conventional design
methods which are built based on mathematical and statistical models.
And traditional methods based solutions are not always optimal as their corresponding decisions are taking only
according to current input.


Rending to their high ability in learning, predicting patterns,
and taking decisions accordingly, AI techniques, on the other
hand, lead to enhancing wireless network performance in
situations where legacy techniques fail to.

Searching in a
very large angular space is essential for achieving high beam 
forming gain and thus, reducing the initial access performance.
The process of aligning beams between two communicating
entities leads to communication and computational overhead.
The good news, however, is that ML and DL-based initial
access methods have the potentials in reducing such overhead [46], [47]. Moreover, the immense power of quantum
computers in speeding up ML algorithms can be investigated
not only for beam alignments, but also for some other services
such as users tracking [28].

clustering and allocating power for mobile users in
mmWave-NOMA demand high computational power, as they
need to be updated in real time. Emerging AI techniques can
overcome some of these limitations




The advent and advancements of technologies may also pave
the way to generate more powerful attackers who can create
sophisticated attacks on different parts of 6G architecture.
